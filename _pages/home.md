"Well Patrick, I must admit that the site runs just a smidgin faster than it did with *****; that is if you define smidgin as light speed on steroids.  I think I just tabbed through the whole site in less time than it took me to open our home page with *****; and I mean that literally, I really did.  Great job!"
