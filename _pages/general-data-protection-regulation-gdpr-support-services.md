		<h3>Why it's important to have a trusted advisor</h3>		
			<p>Set for enforcement on May 26, 2018, the GDPR supersedes the Data Protection Act 1998 in the UK to expand the requirements of storing personal data, improve governance and impose more stringent sanctions on organisations that fail to secure individual's data.</p>
<p>Critical Path Security's team of GDPR specialists can ease the transition into compliance.</p>
	<p><strong>What are you required to do?</strong></p>
<p>Amongst a variety of technical and organisational measures enforced by the GDPR is the need to protect personal data against unauthorised processing, accidental loss and destruction.</p>
<p>GDPR defines this in Article 25 as,</p>
<blockquote><p>Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also mandated by the regulation is the need to have robust procedures in place to detect and investigate personal data breaches as well as report them within 72 hours to a relevant authority.  This is explained in greater detail in Article  33.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.</p></blockquote>
	<p><strong>Do it really apply to us?</strong></p>
<p>The GDPR applies to all organisations that process applicable personal data, or handle and store information on a client’s behalf.</p>
<p>The GDPR places obligations on both data ‘controllers’ and ‘processors’. Data controllers are defined as those who determine the purpose and manner in which data is processed, while data processors are defined as any third party, such as an Outsourced IT group or Cloud Platform Provider, that performs the data processing on behalf of the data controller.</p>
<p>GDPR defines personal data as ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person’.</p>
<p>This can be classified as addresses, birth dates, health history, biometrics, and more.</p>
