<p>Security breaches often result in the exposure of sensitive information, which also lead to loss of service and revenue.  In fact, recent estimates place the number of records containing personally identifiable information (PII), which have been stolen in the U.S. over the past few years, at 900,000,000.  The impacts dealt to organizations involved in these breaches are staggering, including massive fines, loss of jobs, and erosion of public trust.   The best way to mitigate losses in the event of any security incident is to have a previously established and rock-solid plan for incident response.</p>
<p>Critical Path Security’s Incident Response service helps companies quickly investigate and remediate attacks.  Our solution follows the six steps recommended by the SANS Institute: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. This level of planning ensures a detailed and thorough plan of action to fall back on, given any unexpected security incident.</p>
<p>Critical Path Security will develop a program to identify and describe the roles and responsibilities of the incident response team members who are testing the plan and putting it into action, should the need arise.  The plan will specify the tools, technologies, and physical resources, where possible, that must be in place to recover breached information or from a network outage.</p>
