	<p>Safeguarding intellectual property and customer privacy are increasingly challenging in today’s virtual information climate. With an average of 4,000 attacks occurring daily, securing data/information is now as critical to the success of businesses as the quality of their products and services. Ignoring the risks and failing to implement effective security measures compromise customer confidence, tarnish brand image, exposure to greater regulatory restrictions, and potential litigation.</p>
