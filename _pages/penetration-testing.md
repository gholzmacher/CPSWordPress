	<p>In the age of high-profile data breaches, businesses are becoming increasingly concerned about their networks being targeted and are placing greater emphasis on incident response, detection, and remediation efforts to protect high-value information.  However, even sophisticated security strategies will be ineffective if people, processes, and technology aren’t tested often to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.  Knowing of your threat landscape is one of the greatest steps you can take toward improving your security posture.</p>
<p>Critical Path Security penetration testing solutions help organizations address this challenge by performing checks and scans on all applications, systems, or websites to identify potential security gaps. We apply the same techniques that can be used by an attacker, all conducted within a controlled and safe environment. By attempting to breach your company’s security infrastructure and exploit vulnerabilities, we expose critical liabilities that your company faces from the perspective of a motivated attacker.</p>
