	<p>Cyber attacks are increasing at an alarming rate and pose a very real threat to business with severe consequences; over half of breached firms reported decreased share prices, while all experience negative impacts on brand image and customer confidence.  This trend is further exacerbated by the fact that cybersecurity roles are facing an unprecedented skills shortage, with hundreds of thousands of roles going unfilled.  Simply put, companies have no means of keeping up with accelerating threats and implementing industry best practices and policies related to people, process, and technology.</p>
<p>Critical Path Security bridges the gap by providing companies with on-demand access to seasoned experts, who can develop, implement, and manage your information security strategy.  Our team has experience running security operations for companies of all sizes across a wide range of industry segments.  The fractional model also helps level the playing field for many companies by giving them the benefits of having a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at a cost that makes financial sense.</p>
