A glance at any media outlet shows that cyber attacks are more advanced and prevalent than seen in the past. Additionally, it is clear that virtually no company is immune to a cyber incident. Almost all companies and associations collect and store sensitive data, whether it is customer or employee data, intellectual property, or other confidential information.

Critical Path Security's Founder, Patrick Kelley, was recently interviewed by multiple news outlets regarding the increases of these events.

Of the numerous topics covered was the rising costs associated with a cyber incident, which are often quite severe. For example, the costs associated with a data breach may include forensic and investigative activities, and downtime of business-critical applications, lawsuits.

None of these will nearly be as impactful as the impact on the organization's reputation. There is no legal settlement that will absolve a business in the "Court of Public Opinion".

If for a moment you doubt this, consider the single word "Target". Regardless of the future positive effects of the corporation's actions, it will forever be synonymous with one of the most visible breaches of all time. That attack was centered around a relationship with a close 3rd party vendor.

What does this have to do with M&amp;A's?

As the threat of cyber attacks increases, acquiring companies must be prudent to familiarize themselves with an acquisition’s cyber risks and remediation strategies, such as warranties in the acquisition agreement and what insurance policies exist for cyber attacks, for the sole purpose of minimizing that risk associated in the acquisition process.

Understanding and addressing cyber risks in connection with an acquisition is important for both parties. This is a non-negligible task. Getting a true grasp of this arrangement will an undertaking, to say the least. Breaches can last for months or years after the acquisition is finalized. While the acquiring organization is getting a handle on an acquisition whose primary language is the difference and regulatory compliance even more so, the possibility of missing a critical configuration in the firewall or VPN is extraordinarily likely.

Unfortunately, attackers are well aware of this dilemma.

It is quite often the case that an acquiring company will take ownership of a smaller organization that doesn't possess the same maturity in regards to cybersecurity and that is a real problem. If a breach is discovered the day after the acquisition, it is the newly minted owner's problem. An acquiring party should define the absolute minimum requirements for the acquired party to join the network and other associated assets.

Did we mention that with the introduction of GDPR, a breach can be absolutely devastating? In short, a single breach can sufficiently bankrupt a business.

Buyers must conduct due diligence to analyze the potential cyber risks associated with an acquisition target.

Such due diligence may include a full detail and outline of the identification of sensitive data and data assets, the location of sensitive data and data assets, cybersecurity infrastructure, the presence of cybersecurity policies and procedures, including tabletop testing, penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and corrective follow-up.

As mentioned at the beginning of this post, the risk of a cyber incident occurring continues to increase, and the magnitude of the costs associated with a cyber incident is likely on the rise. In the context of M&amp;A, the basis for adequately accounting for cyber risk for all parties is conducting a thorough investigation into the potentially acquired company’s cyber history, and its infrastructure and policies. Parties armed with this knowledge may then consider appropriate remediation steps, negotiations to a realistic acquisition cost, and the total quantification of costs associated with remediation and timetables associated with Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M).

Finally, no matter what actions take place... people will always be the greatest threat to a newly minted merger or acquisition. Be it based on confusion or the deliberate act of a disgruntled employee that feels jaded during the acquisition, a human will be the biggest threat. Make certain that appropriate training is applied to the HumanOS.
