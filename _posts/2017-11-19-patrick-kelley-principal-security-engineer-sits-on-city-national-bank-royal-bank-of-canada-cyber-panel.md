We live in an era of increasingly prevalent cybercrime. The first wave of hacking seemed to only target large companies that stored masses of sensitive data. Stories about credit card numbers and contact information being stolen from retail stores made major news headlines. These days, unfortunately, it looks as if cybercriminals have discovered the gold mine that is business data. That’s the bad news. The worse news is that too many businesses are unprepared for the size of the threat we’re now facing. Surveys show that over 50% of have no cyber protection protocols in place and 60% did nothing to increase their security after being attacked.

Patrick Kelley joined Robert Frost, Scott Saugenbaum, Melody McAnally, and Barbara Allen-Watkins to discuss discovery, response, and recovery from cyber and wire fraud.
