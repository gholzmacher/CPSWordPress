Jeff's love for technology began at age 9 with BASIC and an Apple IIc. He is a veteran full-stack software developer. With over 15 years of professional and leadership experience in Information Technology, he brings a wealth of knowledge to Critical Path Security.

Jeff recently spent 6 years working as the lead developer for indie game maker Zeolite Studios Inc., where he managed the full lifecycle of video game development.

We look forward to his positive impact on Critical Path Security's Managed Security Operations and the Leargas Security Platform.
