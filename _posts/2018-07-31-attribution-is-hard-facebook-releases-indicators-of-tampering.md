Live thread...

In the coming days, we will dissect the statements made and give commentary on our own investigations.
<blockquote>We’re still in the very early stages of our investigation and don’t have all the facts — including who may be behind this. But we are sharing what we know today given the connection between these bad actors and protests that are planned in Washington next week. We will update this post with more details when we have them, or if the facts we have change.</blockquote>
