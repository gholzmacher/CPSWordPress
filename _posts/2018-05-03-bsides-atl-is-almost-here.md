Have you got your ticket for BSides ATL yet? If not, hurry before they sell out and come join us at the Kennesaw State University Center this Saturday, May 5th for this great event!

Critical Path Security is proud to be an official sponsor of this event for and by information security community members.

BSides creates opportunities for individuals to participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. This year's theme is "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants" and will focus on how the success of our predecessors fuels future innovations.

Swing by the Critical Path Security booth anytime to check out some cool tech demos, have a conversation about security, or pick up a limited edition gun-wielding-unicorn t-shirt we had made specifically for BSides ATL 2018. Donations to the Electronic Frontier Foundation are appreciated. If you can’t find the time to catch us at the booth during the day because the talks were just too appealing you couldn’t break away (we don’t blame you), no worries! You can catch us over at Hudson Grille after the final closing notes have been delivered where we will be hosting the official BSides ATL 2018 after party.

We'll be providing light appetizers and conversation.

We hope to see you this Saturday at 9 AM at the KSU Center!
