Critical Path Security is excited to announce that our CTO, Patrick Kelley, will be presenting at BSides Toronto this year!

The topic will be CyberZoology: Protecting your network from new breeds of attacks with a Raspberry Pi.

If you are in the area, we invite you to come out and support the Canadian Security Industry!
