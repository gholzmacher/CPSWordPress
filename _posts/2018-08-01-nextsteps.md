Another week... another set of breaches.  Yesterday, Facebook released core information around removing bad actors from their network.  Today, Reddit announced that they were breached back in 2007.
<blockquote>Tomorrow... who knows?</blockquote>
I’ve had the fortune of working in Information Technology for over 20 years.  In that time, I’ve realized that this industry is constantly evolving. However, the recent and rapid adoption of cloud-based services has caused a disruption at a magnitude that I had not yet seen.  Unfortunately, it is also happening at a rate that isn’t properly allowing Information Security groups to properly gauge the security ramifications.

When I first entered this industry, networks were far easier to secure.  We had differentiating operational goals, but what we secured were largely single, flat, and enormous networks with only a handful of entry points.  All data and assets lived within that one or two physical environments with their own dedicated controls. When we built our enterprise networks, we would build them to support the maximum resources needed to support the assets and needs within that single environment.  It was very linear and, in comparison, far easier to scope and manage than the networks we support today. Much like today, our worst enemy was downtime, but the rules of engagement has changed, as have the margins for error.
<blockquote>What do users want?  Everything right here. Right now. Oh yeah, we want it to be as cost-effective as possible.</blockquote>
This often means that the “Crown Jewels” live in many new places, around the globe.  Several within the corporation’s complete control, many which does not. Currently, AWS operates in as many as 13 distinct locations around the world.  That’s a lot of entry and exit points for your data to move. With the rate of migration and architectural change, most Information Security groups haven’t had the time or resources to assure that proper monitoring is taking place in these new realms.

Let’s face it… It’s a pretty rough day when you experience a breach or network outage in your own network, but it becomes far more complicated when it occurs in your partner’s network.  In reality, the headlines read largely the same.

In addition our research shows that firewall configuration complexity is leaving companies exposed. The technology to keep your networks safe exists, but it’s nearly impossible to manage properly.  We can't begin to calculate the amount of devices connected a network with default credentials that remain unseen by system administrators for months and years.

That's where Critical Path Security comes in. We've built a Managed SOC offering that takes this burden off your shoulders.

Specifically, Critical Path Security sensors are built on Bro-IDS and other opensource technologies that can live at multiple points throughout your core network. With an expert team of analysts, incident responders, and engineers, Critical Path Security can work with your team to handle those difficult situations.

We understand that innovation is happening and at a rapid pace. We've lived in it for decades. With the ease of engaging the Critical Path Security team, you can rollout new network coverage in a defined, lockstep approach to make sure you don’t miss an attack on your new infrastructure or initiative.  Best of all, you can launch new sensors when you need the coverage, not months or years beforehand.

With our service, you always have the most recent detections, protocol analysis, and sensor technology, located in a Data Centre that will adhere to your governance and regulatory compliances.  We perform all of the research and development; you reap all of the benefits.

Wherever your business is today and headed tomorrow. Let us reduce your worries. We’re here to help.
